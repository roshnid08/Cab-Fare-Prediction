# \# Cab Fare Prediction

# 

# Conducted exploratory data analysis on real-world cab ride data to identify key factors influencing fare pricing.  

# 

# Built and evaluated machine learning models using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to accurately predict fares.  

# 

# Applied techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model performance optimization using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².  

# 

# Gained hands-on experience simulating real-world data science workflows in a collaborative, industry-mentored setting. 

# 

# \*NOTE - I WILL CHANGE THE METRICS AND TOOLS AND MODELS AFTER I HAVE FINISHED THE PROJECT AS THIS IS BASE EXAMPLE FOR NOW.
